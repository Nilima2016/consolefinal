    <h1>Project on Console</h1>
    <p> Visual Studio Code is a freeware source code editor made for Windows, Linux and Mac. Some of the features are debugging, syntax highligthing, intellegent code completion, snippets, code refactoring and more. Users are able to change theme, keyboard shortcuts and even install extentions to help them with the code like live testing. 
    

    <p>Console Screen is what coding I have written. To open the console screen click right on the mouse in the screen. Click On Inspect. Click On Console.

 console.log("My First Console Project");
 var first_name="Nilima"
 var last_name="Pahari"
console.log(first_name.concat(last_name));

var a =10;
var b=5;
var add = a + b;
console.log(add);
  var subtract = a - b;
    console.log(subtract);
  var multiply = a * b;
  console.log(multiply);
  var divide = a / b;
  console.log(divide)
